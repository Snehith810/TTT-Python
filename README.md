# TTT-Python
This is the same Tic Tac Toe game but this is written in Python.

## The rules of the game:
Player one plays 'x' while player two plays 'o'. They need to pick a box where their symbol will be plotted. 
If a player's symbol is a form of triplet consecutively, the player wins the game. All the best!
